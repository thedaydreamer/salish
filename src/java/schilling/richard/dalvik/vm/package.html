This package implements a dalvik VM in Java.  It is being implemented in stages:

<ol>
<li>The code verification steps are ported from C.  See CodeVerify.cpp
<li>The VM runtime is ported from C without the just in time compiler.
<li>The Just in time compiler is ported from C, and or used as a JNI hook.
<li>Hooks are added to the virtual machine to help with code analysis and debugging.
</ol>

In addition, documentation happens along the way to ensure that other people will get use out of the virtual machine.

<p>The code in this package and its sub packages uses the class model in package schilling.richard.dalvik.model.
